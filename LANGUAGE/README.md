## Large Language Models

### Does LLM output inherently violate copyright law?
The copyright status of LLM-generated text is not defined by statute, so it is hard to make confident claims, but precedent exists for computer-generated art and other works created by non-humans. Here is what the US Copyright office has to say:[1]
> The Office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants. Likewise, the Office cannot register a work purportedly created by divine or supernatural beings, although the Office may register a work where the application or the deposit copy(ies) state that the work was inspired by a divine spirit.
>
> [...]
>
> Similarly, the Office will not register works produced by a machine or mere mechanical process that operates randomly or automatically without any creative input or intervention from a human author."

### ChatGPT in action:

PROMPT: Define and elaborate in point form what are foundation models, in layman's terms, appropriate for a wide audience of non-experts.

CHATGPT: Foundation models are large neural networks that are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn the patterns and relationships between words and phrases. These models can then be used as a starting point for building other, more specific AI applications, such as chatbots or language translation systems. Here are some key points to understand:

* Foundation models are like a "language brain" that can understand and generate natural language.
* They are trained on massive amounts of text data from the internet, books, and other sources.
* These models can learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases, allowing them to understand language in a more nuanced way.
* They can also generate new text, such as completing sentences or writing articles.
* Foundation models are useful because they can be adapted to specific tasks or industries, such as healthcare or finance.
* They are often the starting point for more specialized AI applications, such as chatbots or language translation systems.
* Examples of foundation models include OpenAI's GPT and Google's BERT.

Overall, foundation models are a crucial development in AI that enable machines to understand and generate natural language in a more sophisticated way than ever before.
