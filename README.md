Experiments with Foundation Models.

["A foundation model is a large artificial intelligence model trained on a vast quantity of unlabeled data at scale (usually by self-supervised learning) resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.[1][2] Foundation models have helped bring about a major transformation in how AI systems are built since their introduction in 2018." - Foundation models - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models)
